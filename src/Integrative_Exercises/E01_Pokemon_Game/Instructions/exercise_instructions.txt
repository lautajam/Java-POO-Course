A Pokemon fan wants to implement for the modeling of a video game the different attacks of each of these creatures.
For this, it has an abstract class called Pokemon, which has the attributes: num_pokedex, namePokemon, weightPokemon,
sex, seasonWhichAppears and type,
and implements methods for the common attacks that most of them have, among them are: attackPlunge(), attackStab() and
attackBite().
However, this fan also developed a series of interfaces to contemplate attacks by Pokemon's of a certain type:
-IElectric:with the methods attackThunderclap(), attackFistThunder(), attackRay(), attackChargeRay().
-Plant: with the methods attackParalyze(), attackDrain(), attackSharpBlade(), attackWhipStrain().
-Fire: with the methods attackPFistFire(), attackAcquires(), attackFlamethrower().
-Water: with the methods attackHydro-pump(), attackWaterGun(), attackBubble(), attackHydro-pulse().
From these interfaces, the Poke-fan wants to create the classes that handle the main characters of the video game,
which are  of the video game, which are the Pokemon starters of the first season (Charmander, Bulbasaur and Squirtle)
and Pikachu. To do so, bear in mind that: Charmander is fire type, Bulbasaur is plant type, Squirtle is water type and
Pikachu is electric type. Once implemented the abstract class and interfaces, overwrite the corresponding methods
to adapt them to each Pókemon showing a message in screen that indicates which pókemon it is and which attack it is
carrying out, for example: "I am Charmander and I am attacking with Ascuas" or "I am Pikachu and I am attacking with
tackle".  After doing the above, create the necessary instances and call each of the methods of each Pokemon.
